    "## Data Description \n",
    "\n",
    "The **2020-2021 Bilingual Program Dataset** was sourced from NYC OpenData. The information within this dataset reports all of the bilingual programs in New York City for the 2020-2021 school year, sorted by program type and language per school. It is organized by borough and school district. NYC OpenData was developed as part of an initiative to make the NYC government more accessible, transparent and accountable. The open, free, public data is produced by various city agencies, including the Department of Education, Department of Buildings, New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, Board of Corrections, etc. By centralizing data from all these NYC agencies, the hope is that citizens will have a more efficient way to find useful, machine-readable data.\n",
    "This particular data is owned and provided by the New York City Department of Education. Regarding influences on data collection, because this should be a comprehensive list of schools with bilingual programs in the city, there should not be schools that are excluded, at least not on purpose. Whether a school has a bilingual program or not is public information and should be relatively easy to collect, and thus there should not be any problems in terms of collection bias and recording. The stakeholders here are the schools, not any individuals in particular, so there should also not be problems with the misuse of information, especially since it is not personal information. Data collected within this dataset that was preprocessed includes the language translated column to the language written in English. For example, columns that indicate the language as Spanish have the language translated column to be preprocessed to Español. In addition, the school DBN column was also preprocessed from the given school name as individuals are more likely to know the school name and then the data preprocesses the name of the school to the school DBN. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 538 rows, each corresponding to a different NYC school. There are 11 columns, detailing borough, borough/citywide office, district, school, school name, school category (K-8, elementary, early childhood, etc.), program, program language, program language translated into the respective language, whether the school is a general or special education school, and special education model. Based on the website, there is no evidence of preprocessing of the data. However, the data is quite clean already, so it could be possible that there was some data cleaning done on the part of NYC OpenData, primarily just figuring out which schools had bilingual programs, and inputting all the corresponding information about the school itself to prevent the dataset from having any null or NaN values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the bilingual dataset, the **2019-20 Demographic Snapshot Dataset** was also sourced from NYC Open Data which was created by the NYC government in order to make the NYC government more accessible and transparent. Likewise, this dataset is also owned by the NYC Department of Education.This dataset details student demographics and enrollment data by school from 2015-2016 through 2019 to 2020. These enrollment counts were taken on October 31st for all of the audited register schools for each school year. There are 9,096 rows and 39 columns with each column detailing specific information regarding the schools in the rows. Some of the columns include the DBN, the year that the count was taken in, the breakdown by school grade, ethnic breakdown, and the percentage of students in poverty at the school. The 9096 rows do not include 9096 individual schools but rather each school can have multiple rows in order to detail the snapshot for each individual year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data was recorded on October 31st for all of the years for all of the schools, the numbers presented do not account for the whole makeup of the population till the end of the year. For example, students who moved to a new school are not counted for if they joined after October 31st. Because the observations were from an audited register, the schools could not change their numbers significantly since the observation was accounted for by an official. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing conducted during the collection of this dataset includes determining the definition of poverty and the threshold students need to meet in order to be counted into the percentage of poverty reported to the Department of Education on this particular dataset. Along with the poverty threshold, preprocessing also includes forming the economic need index. \n",
    "The schools were not involved in the process of data collection. Although we are counting the number of students within each category, the students were not involved in the process of data collection and the purpose of this dataset that is provided by the NYCDOE is to create more transparency and accountability amongst the schools and the public. \n"

    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "Our goal for data cleaning was to merge two datasets together, one containing a list of all the schools in NYC that had bilingual programs, and another that contained demographic data for each school. To do this, we first cleaned each separately by fixing data types to match each other and keeping only the data for the year that we wanted. We got rid of the null values and then merged the two datasets."

    "## Data Limitations \n",
    "\n",
    "One potential problem with our datasets is the fact that the list of bilingual schools programs is the final publication for the year 2020-2021, while our demographic data is based on 2019-2020 data. However, because it would likely take longer than one school year for the demographics of an area to change a notable amount that it would make a change when doing data analysis, this should not be a substantial problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential problem could be the specificity of the raw data. For example, the raw bilingual school data designates the schools by borough and district, however, if we want to get more specific about the location, the zip code of the school might be needed. However, this potential could be solved by manually entering this data based on the name of the school. Furthermore, the raw data does not provide the ethnic breakdown of the individual school. Therefore, when mapping the bilingual data to the demographic data, we might be overlooking the fact that the makeup of the school might not match the demographic makeup of the neighborhood. This could be because children might not always go to the school that is closest to them, but they could be traveling outside of their zone. For elementary schools, because of severe overcrowding in some neighborhoods and certain schools being more popular, some children will be assigned to another school outside of their zone. For middle school, there are zoned schools, where most students go, but there are also choice districts, where students are guaranteed a seat in the district, but can apply to the school that they like, which could be outside of the zone in which they live. For high school, students can choose schools elsewhere in the city from where they live. Therefore, there could be problems regarding mapping demographics to schools based solely on location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential limitiation to this data is that there are multiple lanauges that could correspond to a specific ethnic group. For example, there are language programs in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, but these individual races are not specified in the demography data; there is only Asian. This coudl also happen with lanauges such as French, Russian, Italian, and Polish. This could be possibly be addressed by grouping the certain languages together. This could end up making too many assumptions about the population, especially about who speaks what language. To combat this, we look into getting more specific demographic data if this becomes a central part of the project."
